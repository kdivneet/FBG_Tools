        <h2 className="animated-heading">üîç What is a Fiber Bragg Grating?</h2>
        <p>
          An FBG is a segment of an optical fiber where the refractive index is periodically varied. These variations reflect specific wavelengths while transmitting others. This fundamental property enables their use as optical filters and sensors. It is a remarkable innovation in the world of optical sensing‚Äîessentially a finely tuned mirror etched inside an optical fiber. Within a small segment of the fiber, the refractive index is periodically altered, forming a microscopic pattern that reflects specific wavelengths of light while allowing others to pass through.
        </p>
        <p>
          This selective reflection isn‚Äôt just a neat optical trick‚Äîit forms the basis for highly accurate sensing. FBGs act like spectral gatekeepers, responding to changes in temperature, strain, pressure, or vibration by shifting the wavelength of the reflected light. This makes them incredibly valuable in diverse applications‚Äîfrom monitoring the stability of bridges and slopes, to ensuring the safety of aircraft structures, to even tracking biological signals in medical settings. Compact, passive, and immune to electromagnetic interference, FBGs transform ordinary optical fibers into intelligent sensing systems, offering real-time insights with impressive precision and reliability. In essence, they are the silent sentinels of modern engineering, turning beams of light into powerful diagnostic tools.

        <h2 className="animated-heading">üß† How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>
          When light travels through an FBG, only a specific wavelength‚Äîthe Bragg wavelength‚Äîis reflected. This reflection is highly sensitive to strain and temperature changes, making FBGs ideal for environmental and structural monitoring.
        </p>
        <video controls src="/videos/bragg_reflection.mp4" className="styled-video" />
        <figcaption>Bragg reflection visualized: Only a narrow band of light is reflected.</figcaption>
        <p>
          Instead of simply passing through the optical fiber uninterrupted, part of the light is selectively reflected. This occurs because the FBG contains a periodic modulation of the refractive index within the fiber core, forming a structure that behaves like a wavelength-specific mirror. Only a particular wavelength of light‚Äîknown as the Bragg wavelength‚Äîis reflected, while all others continue to propagate through the fiber.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes this even more fascinating is that the Bragg wavelength is highly sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment. When the fiber experiences mechanical strain or temperature variations, the spacing and refractive index of the grating subtly change. As a result, the reflected wavelength shifts. By accurately measuring this shift, one can determine the precise amount of strain or temperature change affecting the fiber.
        </p>
        <p>
          This sensitivity enables FBGs to serve as highly effective sensors in a variety of fields, including structural health monitoring, aerospace engineering, biomedical diagnostics, and energy systems. Whether embedded in bridges to detect stress, integrated into aircraft wings to monitor deformation, or used in medical devices to track physiological changes, FBGs provide real-time, reliable data without the need for bulky equipment or electrical power sources. Their ability to convert physical changes into readable optical signals makes them an essential tool in modern sensing technology.
