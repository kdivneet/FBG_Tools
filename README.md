# FBG-Simulator: Tools & Intelligent Assistant for Bragg Grating Applications

The **FBG-Simulator** is a unified, web-based platform built to simplify and accelerate the study and practical use of **Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)** technology. This tool combines interactive calculators, data visualization modules, and an AI-powered domain-specific chatbotâ€”offering a complete learning and development environment for students, researchers, and engineers.

## Key Features

* **FBG-Specific Chatbot**: Built using GPT-2 and fine-tuned with domain QA pairs, the chatbot responds exclusively to FBG-related queries.
* **Automated QA Generation**: QA pairs are generated from PDFs and websites using web scraping and language models (LLaMA, T5), then saved in JSON formats for training.
* **Interactive Visualizations**: Concepts are dynamically presented using modern frontend tools (React, Framer Motion) for enhanced understanding.

## Model Training

The chatbot model was trained and fine-tuned on Google Colab using GPT-2, with additional constraint filtering via **Logistic Regression** to ensure domain-specific relevance.
